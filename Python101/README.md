# Python 101
This repository contains all the assignments in Python code I wrote during my Python course this semester. Since it's only contains basic Python scripts there's no need for any external libraries. 

What you'll find here:

- Python scripts covering various topics learned in a Python Course.
- Each script should ideally be named descriptively to reflect its purpose (e.g., variables.py, loops.py).
- You can expect basic concepts like:
  - Variables and data types
  - Operators and expressions
  - Control flow (if/else, loops)
  - Functions
  - Basic data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
