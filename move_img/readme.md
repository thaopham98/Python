# Moving images in Downloads to a new folder

In this project, I want to move all the images in my Downloads folder to a new folder. I use 2 modules, **os** and **shutil**. 

## **shutil** module

The `shutil` module in Python provides a set of high-level file operations that make it easier to manipulate files and directories. It is part of the standard library, which means it comes bundled with Python and **does not require any external installation**.

## **os** module

The `os` module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. It offers a range of functions for performing operating system-related tasks, such as file and directory operations, process management, environment variables, and more. The os module is part of the Python standard library and **does not require any external installation**.
